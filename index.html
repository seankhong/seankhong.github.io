    <p class="card-text"><p>Yo Sean, Happy 19th Birthday! Hope you have a great one after your final operation in service term. </p>

<p>It has been a great honour meeting you and getting to know you better across the years. Be it the training sessions for FDP, post NCC Dinners, random gym sessions and the extremely selective and occasional suppers (ahem), it has unduitably been a blast through it all. It's definitely rare to come across someone like you who meets life so head on and stays optimistic and humble through it all. I hope you continue to do so and stay cheerful in the face of adversities. I am confident NS and OCS has impacted and inspired you in some ways and crafted certain ideologies through the experience and journey you’ve gone through. As a future corporal to be, I know you’ll be a great officer that inspires his men and establishes a strong sense of camaraderie amongst them all. Keep it up Sean and never give up or KT will come and find you too.</p>

<p>Although it has been a true difficulty and a constant struggle meeting you in real life (LOL jk but also true), we should try to find a time where all of us can get a meet up now that we’ve moved into Phase 2. I understand that such a scenario will be difficult to come by with the additional inclusion of a certain someone that you’ve decided to hide from us since last year June till POP, but regardless of that fact, we should still TRY to meet up LOL.</p> 

<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon! God bless you and stay strong bro. Have a wonderful 19th birthday!</p>
